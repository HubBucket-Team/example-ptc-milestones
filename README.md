Example repository using milestones for PTCs 

- Each PTC is represented by a milestone that can have an optional due date and description. Note the description is unformatted text, not markdown
- The current state of the PTCs are visible in the main issue list by clicking on the milestones button.
- Progress towards the PTC is tracked by opening issues that are assigned the milestone. 
- PTC milestones must begin with something like "PTC:" to distinguish them from other milestones.
